var:

On using the var we can redeclare the value for a variable and also reassignment can be done.

For example:

var name = "Hari"
var name = "karan"

Now my name variable was redeclared to a new value and also it got reassigned.


let:

On using the let we can't redeclare the value for a variable and only reassignment can be done.

For example:

let name = "Hari"
let name = "karan" //This will throw error. So i need to use as name = "karan"

Now my name variable was got reassigned to a new value.
